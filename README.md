# SlotsMachine
The code provides a basic structure for a slot machine game, allowing players to experience the excitement of spinning the machine and potentially winning prizes based on symbol combinations. Players can deposit funds, select the number of lines to bet on, and adjust their bet amounts. The code handles validation and provides feedback on winnings and remaining balance.
I made this slotmachine following a youtube video by "Tech With Tim", to help me learn python and become more confident in creating my own projects.
